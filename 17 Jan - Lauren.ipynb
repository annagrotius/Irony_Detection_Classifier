      "(780, I am a youth minister.  To some comments in this thread, I'd like to respond.  Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus' day, you're right, it didn't exist.  (And it doesn't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below) Neither did adolescence, and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day.  Now, it isn't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence, quite the opposite.  (Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point [here](http://www. faithformationlearningexchange. net/uploads/5/2/4/6/5246709/ym-doesnt-exist. pdf)) Yes, youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself, is not the church.  Yes, a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service, or making church a carnival so the kids won't leave, or making it a funeral so they won't mess up the church with their hijinks, is bad.  Yes, like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success, youth can be bad.  But there is a theology of youth ministry, thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean (www. kendadean. com) and  Andrew Root (www. andrewroot. org) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations.  \n",

Youth ministry is not the [one-eared Mickey Mouse model](http://www. abpnews. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/one-eared-mickey. jpg), but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church.  At my church, our youth group acts as small group.  We have our own worship on Wednesday, where they learn to lead and create and engage, to find their voice and get content, and contextualize, but we also do everything the greater church does.  Taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because there's no other option is sad for church kids, and disastrous for unchurched kids.  \n",

      "Youth ministry IS \"letting the children come to Jesus\" I am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth, not a pastor solely for youth.

Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence, who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most?   I'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer.   The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state's constitution before assuming powers not expressed.

Why are they more worried about the drug use that would stem from marijuana (a less addictive drug than alcohol) yet blatantly ignore both the alcoholism and drug use that can come from early drinking.  Maybe its because there isn't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking.  Wouldn't marijuana go through the same thing alcohol did when it became legal, more social acceptance and knowledge of the drug allowing for more conversations between kids and their parents about the right way to do these things without leading to increased hardcore drug use.) <class 'tuple'>\n",

I don't necessarily like Clinton but she would win 2016 ensuring that the Supreme court would be dominated by Liberals for the foreseeable future.  It would be easier for a liberal Supreme court to overrule previous rulings like Citizen United than it would for Congress, which will remain divided due to the Republican gerrymandering of crucial swing states that allow them to hold the House despite losing the popular vote.  The greatest strength Republicans had until 2010 was that they fell in line.  This is what Democrats have done since then and it has allowed us to hold the Presidency along with the Senate.  Elizabeth Warren is to the Democrats as Ted Cruz is to the Republicans; they represent the the beliefs of the base but do not reflect the attitudes of the general electorate which, despite Obama's election and reelection, remains centre-right.  All she would do is hurt Hillary in the Primary by forcing Hillary to move further to the left just as Santorum and Gingrich forced Romney to move further and further to the right.  Winning the 2016 election is all that matters.  Fall in line.  The day will come when we can elect a candidate like Senator Warren but it is not this day.  Don't confuse me for a moderate as I fall into the British School of Economics and would like nothing more than to see a re-implementation of New Deal fiscal policy but our current political climate will not allow that and losing the presidency would allow Republicans to cut more programs than we are seeing now with Obama.

(and growing in numbers) coinciding with watching our 20 and 30 somethings leave Vermont to pursue job opportunities and business opportunities out of state.   It's unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most.    Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence, who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most?   I'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer.   The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state's constitution before assuming powers not expressed.

       " There are surely sources of news that are better than others.   If you rely on 24-hour cable news channels like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News as your sole sources of news, then yes - you deserve constant ridicule.   If you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you, you deserve being ignored.   If you get all your political news from one political perspective, you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a fact-oriented discussion.   Those people are the problem.   They're the ones that resort to making claims of \"mainstream media bias\" which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion.  But what about us readers who rely on SEVERAL sources to make our conclusion!?   On Syria for example, I read the Washington Post, Guardian, Reuters, AP, al Jazeera, CNN. com and several other sources.   I heard about the Administrations' claims of intelligence implicating the Syrian regime, of Putin's claims that it was the rebels, I followed the U. N. 's report findings through the Washington Post.   I followed the story as Obama brought it to Congress, the pros/cons, the opinion polls, arguments for and against a strike, the videos of children dying from the Sarin.

Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams, Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results, then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms.  Mike Barborak, a natural language engineer at IBM Research, describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine.  \"It's **language processing** but it's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what's actually being stated,\" Barborak says.

She could have just told a big lie and started Christianity.  She would have had to tell Jesus that he was the son of God to keep the lie going, so he grew up really believing God was his father.  Jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of God, because he just believed what his mother told him.  This inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious, what he called the Holy Spirit.  This gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did.

Why are they more worried about the drug use that would stem from marijuana (a less addictive drug than alcohol) yet blatantly ignore both the alcoholism and drug use that can come from early drinking.  Maybe its because there isn't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking.  Wouldn't marijuana go through the same thing alcohol did when it became legal, more social acceptance and knowledge of the drug allowing for more conversations between kids and their parents about the right way to do these things without leading to increased hardcore drug use.,\n",

       " I am a youth minister.  To some comments in this thread, I'd like to respond.  Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus' day, you're right, it didn't exist.  (And it doesn't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below) Neither did adolescence, and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day.  Now, it isn't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence, quite the opposite.  (Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point [here](http://www. faithformationlearningexchange. net/uploads/5/2/4/6/5246709/ym-doesnt-exist. pdf)) Yes, youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself, is not the church.  Yes, a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service, or making church a carnival so the kids won't leave, or making it a funeral so they won't mess up the church with their hijinks, is bad.  Yes, like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success, youth can be bad.  But there is a theology of youth ministry, thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean (www. kendadean. com) and  Andrew Root (www. andrewroot. org) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations.  \n",

Youth ministry is not the [one-eared Mickey Mouse model](http://www. abpnews. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/one-eared-mickey. jpg), but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church.  At my church, our youth group acts as small group.  We have our own worship on Wednesday, where they learn to lead and create and engage, to find their voice and get content, and contextualize, but we also do everything the greater church does.
