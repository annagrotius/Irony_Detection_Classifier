      "To begin with, the word *protest* [derives](http://www. etymonline. com/index. php? term=protest) from the word *protestari* from Latin which meant \"avowal, pledge, solemn declaration. \"  The first [usage](http://www. etymonline. com/index. php? term=protest&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) as \"statement of disapproval\" is attested in 1751 and is very clearly related to the side-effects of some of the more radical offshoots of the Protestant Reformation.   However, the contemporary sense at the time was very clearly that it was \"a solemn declaration of reformation of the Church around the Gospel's message,\" not as a call to be \"*always criticizing* everything that isn't us\" like this article seems to imply. \n",
      "\n",
      "That anachronism is borne out when we examine what the 15th Century Reformers actually did.   The majority of the Protestant Reformers specifically set out a vision of an \"Evangelical Catholic Church\" that corrected the errors they were protesting.   Furthermore, they generally retained the Creeds and Church Fathers and taught there is \"One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. \"  The clear intention was only to repair the unity of the Church around the Gospel's promise which felt had been disrupted by the abuses in the Medieval Church.   Therefore, this is why most Protestants are not \"protestants\" like this article describes, as the article itself noted. \n",
