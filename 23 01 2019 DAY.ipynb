I actually would venture to say that scriptural knowledge leads us to love and humility., I am a youth minister.  To some comments in this thread, I'd like to respond.  Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus' day, you're right, it didn't exist.  (And it doesn't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below) Neither did adolescence, and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day.  Now, it isn't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence, quite the opposite.  (Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point [here](http://www. faithformationlearningexchange. net/uploads/5/2/4/6/5246709/ym-doesnt-exist. pdf)) Yes, youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself, is not the church.  Yes, a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service, or making church a carnival so the kids won't leave, or making it a funeral so they won't mess up the church with their hijinks, is bad.  Yes, like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success, youth can be bad.  But there is a theology of youth ministry, thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean (www. kendadean. com) and  Andrew Root (www. andrewroot. org) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely I think youth ministry MUST be intergenerational.  As pastor, I am facilitator of relationships and member of relationships.  Youth ministry is not the [one-eared Mickey Mouse model](http://www. abpnews. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/one-eared-mickey. jpg), but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church.  At my church, our youth group acts as small group.  We have our own worship on Wednesday, where they learn to lead and create and engage, to find their voice and get content, and contextualize, but we also do everything the greater church does.  Taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because there's no other option is sad for church kids, and disastrous for unchurched kids.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Youth ministry IS \"letting the children come to Jesus\" I am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth, not a pastor solely for youth.  With someone there to invest in them and relate to them, they have the full access an adult has to someone to disciple them and help them in their journey with God.

Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams, Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results, then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms.  Mike Barborak, a natural language engineer at IBM Research, describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine.  \"It's **language processing** but it's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what's actually being stated,\" Barborak says.  That means looking beyond the words of the diagnosis for a basic sense of how the words fit together, and what each possible diagnosis means. \n",

      "4.   After buying the houses, they are hiring property management companies, contractors, and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible (within 90 days).

Now Blackstone comes in, and offers the opportunity to stay in a house, with the same schools, etc.   This isn't predatory.   People are paying rent, but now they have the option to do so while living in a house. \n",
      "\n",
      "7.   Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone, they are in no hurry to \"flip\" them for profit, because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them.   The new boilers, new roof, and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability.   Most leases are 2 years, so there isn't constant turnover, and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect.   \n",

      "8.   Eventually, the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company, and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work (See the recent IPO of SilverBay:SBY).   The company will continue to own and operate the homes, pay income to shareholders, and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do.   The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multi-family apartment real estate investing.   Not so evil. \n",

Maybe not for a presidential bid, not yet, but his work as an education advocate and science promoter is *desperately* needed to counter some of the more extreme attacks on us.   Rational thinking helps our side., Alright, as a teen I'm going to share my experience with youth ministry.   I go to the Life Teen program at my church almost every Sunday and we're a really tight knit group there.  We actually have deep discussions, instead of just fun and games, and we have an annual summer retreat which is what I always look forward to in the summer.  A lot of the people in the head Youth Ministry office in the archdiocese went to and were leaders of this specific Life Teen.  We frequently do things to help out our church community from service projects, to raising money.  Teens who go to this Llife Teen seem more mature and very involved in the church.

Stalin and Mao I'll give you.   But not Hitler.   Hitler was raised Christian and retained most of his Christian beliefs throughout his life.   He also happened to be batshit crazy so I'm not even going to say that his Christianity caused or facilitated his atrocities.   But he was not an atheist.   I will not budge on that., Well, his \"liberal eugenics\" argument just firmly placed him in the same category as the tea party as he makes up shit that sounds scary and appeals to the uninformed., if he has a gun against an innocent persons head, he deserved to be shot.  yes he might be troubled, he might have a rough past, he might have just fallen in with the wrong crowd.
