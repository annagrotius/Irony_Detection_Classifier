1934,"I prefer it!  I'm a Texan and a while back I had a HORRIBLE kidney stone but I didn't know what it was because I had never had one before, I went to the ER in EXCRUCIATING pain and they treated me wonderfully! 

I got three, count 'em baby three, shots of morphine through an IV, that is an experience I have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend!  Then I left with a handful of prescriptions after a CT scan (is that right?  Some kind of scan! ) and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again.  Woo! 

So then the bill comes and it's $8000!  So at first I was all like ""woah, shit"" so I called and complained because while in the ER I had specifically ask, repeatedly, how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors, nurses, radiologists (or whatever they're called) and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay ""as much as I could afford right now"" (I authorized 50$ because she wouldn't explain to me what exactly it was I was paying for ""right now"" and I finally decided they just wanted a card on file). 

Sooo when the bill comes the scan ALONE was 6000 bucks, just the scan, the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which I would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care I got (and I knew I was uninsured going into this and I knew ERs are expensive and at the time I was in HORRIBLE pain and scared shitless by it so I didn't care).  I made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for JUST THE SCAN?  That seemed unreasonable to me and I also found out later that scans like that aren't necessary for kidney stones and often aren't done unless you're peeing blood, so wtf? 

So this is where the fun starts, I called to complain about this scan cost, I was quite clear that I would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but I couldn't afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts, so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if I qualified for ""financial relief"" from my bill.  I explained again that I didn't want charity, I just wanted a reasonable bill (and BTW, 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too, 800 of that is called an ""ER fee"" and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the ER regardless of what happens next, but hey they took good care of me and I don't know what the fuck morphine costs). 

Anyway the only option I had was to file for the charitable relief, well ya see I am currently a ""stay at home uncle"" my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom, she can't afford day care (you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is) and since I made less money than she does, I become the stay at home parent.  We all live together now, she pays the bills and I take care of the kids.  It was weird at first but it's actually kinda rewarding and fun now (most of the time).  So technically I'm single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that.  Actually do have some income for contract IT work with people who knew me before I quit, it's all under the table though. 

Soooo I got FULL relief.  I actually have some money and my mother actually makes ""ok"" money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill (my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time, lower is better of course but I had braced myself to accept 4 grand if I could negotiate hard enough to get there).  Instead I paid 0$.  And I learned a valuable lesson, if it looks like you have no money you can go to the ER for freeeeee!  Wee! 

So suck it tax payers I ripped you off for 8000 bucks and I have three pain pills left over for a rainy day!

I didn't trust a numerical analysis from someone who things that $52 billion = over half a trillion dollars, so I checked the numbers. 

Using the figures from the the excel spreadsheet they link to, they gained $12 billion in wealth together ($6 billion each).

She could have been raped by a Roman soldier or some other pervert as were thousands of young women.  Back then, the women were penalized more than the rapists.  She could have just told a big lie and started Christianity.  She would have had to tell Jesus that he was the son of God to keep the lie going, so he grew up really believing God was his father.  Jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of God, because he just believed what his mother told him.  This inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious, what he called the Holy Spirit.  This gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did.  He looked for the truth in the present, because he believed God, his father, would try to communicate with him.  Just thinking this opened up the door to the universal mind and the truth and the life.  Jesus was very open-minded and brave.

3.  If we start talking about the Trinity in this context our brains will melt.

I dunno.  I think there are plenty parts of the Bible that are construed as *arguments*.  

Hell, there's a sense in which *any claim that's made about the world* is an argument.  And there's some evidence that ancient texts (in the Hebrew Bible and elsewhere) were written to advance a particular theological view (or even to argue that [insert phenomenon] was in fact not a natural event, but a divinely-sanctioned one). 

I mean, nowhere is this sort of ""argumentation"" any clearer than in the epistles of Paul.  While in some places he assumes an audience familiar with certain aspects of Judaism, we know that his churches were significantly Gentilic.  He would have to totally convince them of the reality of a deity that they did not previously embrace/believe in (""Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made"").  In Acts, the author has Paul challenging Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, and trying to *convince* Athenians to embrace the gospel.

What he probably said is that we could eliminate the coercive monopoly on currency (e. g.  legal tender laws) and still be able to trade with each other just fine.  He's a voluntaryist, so he's obviously fine with currencies that people use voluntarily (e. g.  bitcoin, private currency, silver) not ones that the government forces you to use.

Here's a good rule of thumb for what should be privatized and what shouldn't.    If you want to control the OUTCOME of a given situation, then socialization is the way to go.    The whole raison d'etre for private enterprise is to make money, NOT provide whatever outcome you desire.      

Lets use the example of a sewage system.  

The outcome you want is basic sanitation for obvious reasons. 
Now, you can give that job to government, where the entire enterprise is set up to provide the service without having to make a profit.   If you give that job to private business, their entire purpose is to make money.    Making money takes precedence over providing the service.    One of the primary ways to make money for the private enterprise is to NOT provide the service. 

So when the OUTCOME matters, it's best to pool our resources as a society and bring down the price of the outcome we desire. 

Stossel and other conservatives ignore/reject this simple concept in the vague hopes that someone will be able to take more money from the American taxpayer than the government would in taxes to provide the service in the mistaken belief that privitazation generates more economic growth.    Which even if true, does not negate that 

If privatization works so great, where are the all too obvious examples?    Halliburton isn't exactly a poster child for spending taxpayer dollars efficiently, is it?   The guys who lost their radioactive fracking waste along a texas highway?   The ones who said there's no reason to hold down costs because they;re all passed onto taxpayers?",-1,-1

951,"&gt; Well, one of the reasons some Americans feel they’re being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes, which are low compared to other modern countries, and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries — a lot of our health care costs, higher education costs, admissions and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things — lo and behold, we end up being a relatively high-tax country.  

I've been saying this for years and it never seems to sink in.   To fairly compare taxes in the U. S.  with other countries you have to add in the costs of healthcare and college.   

Corporations corrupting the tax code is a different discussion.

1815,"&gt;Of course, the Obama administration is to blame for the botched rollout, but there are other culprits getting less attention – namely, global tech conglomerate CGI, which was responsible for the bulk of the execution, and in general the ability of big corporations to get massive taxpayer-funded contracts without enough accountability. 

&gt;Government outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades.  Taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies' pockets, about $80bn of which goes to tech companies.  We've reached a stage of knee-jerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias, and it's damaging in multiple levels. 

&gt;For one thing, farming work out often rips off taxpayers.  While the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent, time-wasters drooling over their Texas Instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions, studies show that keeping government services in house saves money.  **In fact, contractor billing rates average an astonishing 83% more than what it would cost to do the work in-house.  Hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the US, while contractors, especially in the IT space, can ship taxpayer-funded work overseas. **

&gt;Fortunately, then, there are alternatives to outsourcing public functions to big corporations padding their profits at taxpayers' collective expense, and it is time we used them...

There are surely sources of news that are better than others.   If you rely on 24-hour cable news channels like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News as your sole sources of news, then yes - you deserve constant ridicule.   If you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you, you deserve being ignored.   If you get all your political news from one political perspective, you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a fact-oriented discussion.   Those people are the problem.   They're the ones that resort to making claims of ""mainstream media bias"" which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion.  But what about us readers who rely on SEVERAL sources to make our conclusion!?   On Syria for example, I read the Washington Post, Guardian, Reuters, AP, al Jazeera, CNN. com and several other sources.   I heard about the Administrations' claims of intelligence implicating the Syrian regime, of Putin's claims that it was the rebels, I followed the U. N. 's report findings through the Washington Post.   I followed the story as Obama brought it to Congress, the pros/cons, the opinion polls, arguments for and against a strike, the videos of children dying from the Sarin.   I am more informed these days than ever before, so this disgruntled guys claims ring hollow.   He just comes across as some pissed off guy.   A cynic without a compelling argument. 

The point is, I am grateful for all these news sources and am not convinced by indignant people like Hersh that they're all ""in the pockets of Obama. ""  Let me ask you this Mr.  Hersh:  what publication is your shining example of journalism?   You sure as hell didn't say.   Who sets the standard on reporting excellence? 

Well, the Guardian lends you credibility by noting **your Pulitzer Prize. **  You're one of the good guys.   So who else is winning this prestigious prize in the area of International Reporting (that he later derides in the article)?   

From the past decade:

* 2013 - NY Times

* 2012 - NY Times

* 2011 - NY Times

* 2010 - Washington Post

* 2009 - NY Times

* 2008 - Washington Post

* 2007 - Wall Street Journal

* 2006 - New York Times

* 2005 - LA Times and Newsday

* 2004 - Washington Post

* 2003 - Washington Post

* 1970 - Dispatch News Service (Seymour M.  Hersh)

So my two most preferred publications (NYT &amp; WP) dominate the Pulitzer prize for international reporting.   Fire 90% of these editors!?   It's trite nothingness.   Any fool can cast stones at an entire profession, but how about he put his money where his mouth is and call out some articles, some editors, some authors?   He indicates a systemic problem but can't even get close to substantiating it! 

Seriously, those who agree with Mr.  Hersh - what news source is your beacon of truth?
