She must have zero memory because she told me on Sunday, "" I called and the plan is no help at all, I will have to pay a lot of money, and have a $6K deductible!  I have been lied to!

1639,"I think the article made it pretty clear that the influence she holds in the senate could have a far greater influence on policy than what she or anyone could do as president.  The senate as a whole absolutely holds more power than the president and therefore senators who can influence the entire body (or at least a majority) hold a unique power in the government.  

Not to mention that her strengths are specifically as a consumer advocate who is tough on Wall Street and banks.  Does that  translate to being a great president?  Not necessarily.  Does it translate to being a great senator?  Absolutely, because you are allowed to focus on a narrower range of interests.  

And lastly, while she has great appeal to liberals and progressives, she doesn't exactly have that same appeal all over the country.  Middle of the road voters, the type you need to win presidential elections, still fear the picture that the right is able to pair of people like her.  To be clear: they don't fear her unfiltered policy ideas, they fear the politician that the right would portray her as.

Someone, somewhere, sometime decided to create a new word that means the same as ""poop"", but isn't ""poop"".  They started using it, and then more people started using it, and then someone decided they were going to be offended by it.  This person then created a rule somewhere that this word is bad.  And then more people began following the rule, and eventually it became a societal norm to believe that ""shit"" was a BAD word, even though it literally means ""poop"", and saying it was a sin.

480,"&gt; Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development involved with those industries, or government contracting.  Some hard working and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before retirement but they are rare. 

&gt;Folks in the top 0. 1% come from many backgrounds but it's infrequent to meet one whose wealth wasn't acquired through direct or indirect participation in the financial and banking industries. 

&gt; Most of the serious economic damage the U. S.  is struggling with today was done by the top 0. 1% and they benefited greatly from it. 

&gt; A highly complex set of laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the uppermost reaches of the U. S.  financial system.  It allows them to protect and increase their wealth and significantly affect the U. S.  political and legislative processes.  They have real power and real wealth.  Ordinary citizens in the bottom 99. 9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood of entering the top 0. 5%, much less the top 0. 1%.  Moreover, those at the very top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. 

So, basically investment bankers, etc have taken over and are now running - and ruining - our country.  They are an existential threat - left alone, their actions **will** kill us.  What do we do about them?  They have so completely twisted the laws so there seems to be no legal recourse for their actions, which suggests the only ways to protect ourselves are extra-legal...

1014,"&gt;As the only socially transformational legislation in modern American history to be enacted on a straight party-line vote, Obamacare is wholly owned by the Democrats.  Its unraveling would catastrophically undermine their underlying ideology of ever-expansive central government providing cradle-to-grave care for an ever-grateful citizenry. 

&gt;For four years, this debate has been theoretical.  Now itâ€™s real.  And for Democrats, itâ€™s a disaster. 

&gt;This is the signature legislative achievement of the Obama presidency, the embodiment of his new entitlement-state liberalism.  If Obamacare goes down, there will be little left of its underlying ideology. 

&gt;Perhaps it wonâ€™t go down.  Perhaps the Web portal hums beautifully on Nov.  30.  Perhaps theyâ€™ll find a way to restore the canceled policies without wrecking the financial underpinning of the exchanges. 

&gt;Perhaps.  The more likely scenario, however, is that Obamacare does fail.  It either fails politically, renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of Democrats, or it succumbs to the financial complications (the insurance â€œdeath spiralâ€�) of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it.

Maybe its because there isn't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking.

*American party coalitions are heterogeneous, but they endure as along as the different groups find more agreement with each other than with the opposition.  After Republicans won back the Congress in 1994, they developed a political strategy to hold their coalition together.  Many people contributed to the strategy including Newt Gingrich, Karl Rove, Paul Coverdell, Paul Weyrich, and Ralph Reed, but the chief architect was probably Grover Norquist, a political operative who, along with Rove and Reed, came of age in the early Reagan years.  The strategy was based on creating an alliance between business, which had sometimes divided its loyalties between Republicans and Democrats, and the array of social and economic interest groups that had begun backing Republicans. *

*In weekly meeting held on Wednesdays at the office of his Americans for Tax Reform, Norquist put forth the idea that business groups, led by the U. S.  Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), but also including the specialized trade associations, should back socially conservative Republican candidates, while right-to-life or gun rights organizations should back tax cuts and deregulation.  What would bind the different parts together was a common opposition to raising taxes, which Norquist framed in a pledge he demanded that Republican candidates make.  Business could provide the money, and the single-issue and evangelical groups the grassroots energy to win elections. *",-1,-1

I kept thinking it was my golden ticket into heaven.  I knew suicide was wrong, but I was too young to be held accountable, so yah! 

I dont remember why I didnt do it to be honest.  I just kept thinking, well, even though my family will be sad, when they get to heaven, we'll be back together.  And killing myself at 7 just seemed like the quickest and surest way there.  I guess I chickened out.  Now as a very happy atheist, it still sends chills down my spine how close I probably got... but who knows, I probably would have stopped as soon as the knife scratched me, cause scratches hurt.

This is why many of us railed against him from the beginning - he was, and remains, completely out of his league from a basic knowledge and experience perspective.   He is not bright enough, not experienced enough, not intelligent enough and certainly not humble enough to understand and **respect** what he and his cohorts do not know.   The administration as a whole acts like the classic first-year grad students who have this sudden epiphany about the utter simplicity of a solution to a long-standing problem that many others have attempted, and failed, to fix.   But it turns out that grad student, more often than not, simply doesn't have enough experience and/or understanding of the true nature of the problem to even begin to propose a solution, and concludes with nothing but a mess on the whiteboard.   

I find, as a conservative by nature, that I tend to hold back on broad promises, boastful solutions, and glamorous statements about fixing things until I have had time to sit and brood and analyze and assess and seek guidance and input from others.

Fixes are not as easy as raising the minimum though, we have a much broader work force (almost all women work outside the home which was less the case in 1950) and much less demand for labor do to automation and computers. 

Its not just factory jobs either, we have tons of software solutions that render human labor far less necessary, heck even the humble voice mail is a job killer. 

So while raising the minimum wage and even indexing it is fair its not going to help very much and might even speed up automation since robotics are getting better by the day. 

There is an  ethical solution, social credit (pay everyone a base wage) combined with  a distributive  economic system (changing the system to incentivize distribution within the middle tier) but they are politically difficult to get into play. 

Also both require big changes, a much smaller military, trade controls  and deep limits to immigration which have other issues. 

And note the current solution of social democracy doesn't work well.  Europe has it and also has heavy youth unemployment and low birth rates.  Its not as bad as actual Marxism (100% fail by volume) but it doesn't seem to resolve the problem.  Its slows the bleeding but it doesn't heal the body.
