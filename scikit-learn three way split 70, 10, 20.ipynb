It's unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most.    Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence, who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most?   I'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer.   The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state's constitution before assuming powers not expressed.

       " I am a youth minister.  To some comments in this thread, I'd like to respond.  Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus' day, you're right, it didn't exist.  (And it doesn't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below) Neither did adolescence, and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day.  Now, it isn't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence, quite the opposite.  (Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point [here](http://www. faithformationlearningexchange. net/uploads/5/2/4/6/5246709/ym-doesnt-exist. pdf)) Yes, youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself, is not the church.  Yes, a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service, or making church a carnival so the kids won't leave, or making it a funeral so they won't mess up the church with their hijinks, is bad.  Yes, like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success, youth can be bad.  But there is a theology of youth ministry, thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean (www. kendadean. com) and  Andrew Root (www. andrewroot. org) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations.  \n",
       " \n",
       " Absolutely I think youth ministry MUST be intergenerational.  As pastor, I am facilitator of relationships and member of relationships.  Youth ministry is not the [one-eared Mickey Mouse model](http://www. abpnews. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/one-eared-mickey. jpg), but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church.  At my church, our youth group acts as small group.  We have our own worship on Wednesday, where they learn to lead and create and engage, to find their voice and get content, and contextualize, but we also do everything the greater church does.  Taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because there's no other option is sad for church kids, and disastrous for unchurched kids.  \n",
       " \n",
       " Youth ministry IS \"letting the children come to Jesus\" I am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth, not a pastor solely for youth.
